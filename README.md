# Churn_Prediction
🔍 Why do bank customers leave? I wanted to find out.
I recently dove into a project to explore customer churn in the banking sector — and it turned out to be a really eye-opening experience!
Here’s what I did: 
✅ Cleaned and prepped a real-world bank dataset using Pandas and NumPy
 ✅ Visualized trends with Matplotlib and Seaborn — from age and geography to salary and balance
 ✅ Built a machine learning model to predict which customers are most likely to churn
 ✅ Uncovered which features actually matter the most (spoiler: age and account activity were huge!)
What started as a simple EDA task quickly became a full-on insightful journey into customer behaviour — and a hands-on way to apply everything I’ve been learning about data science and ML.
🛠️ Tools I used:
 Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
This project helped me connect the dots between data, people, and decisions — and made me even more excited to explore what’s possible in the world of analytics and AI. If you're into data or curious about churn, I’d love to swap ideas!
